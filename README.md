Hi, I’m Nuno,

I am a 37-year-old **software security engineer** looking for a new challenge in an organization that embraces security as paramount in their software development lifecycle.

> *For the last 7 years I have been an **Assistant Professor** at the [Department of Informatics Engineering](http://www.dei.uc.pt) of the [University of Coimbra](http://www.uc.pt). Recently, I decided to change career.*
> 

For over 15 years, I have been researching, developing and teaching software security, dependability, and reliability engineering. 

My research has been helping software engineers to create secure systems through automated tools to find vulnerabilities and attacks, and also by proposing benchmarking approaches to select the best alternatives for their use.

I am expert in code reviews, testing, static analysis, fault injection, vulnerability injection and benchmarking, that I have applied over the years in the assessment of the security and dependability of web and mobile applications, web services, intrusion detection systems, virtualized environments, intelligent systems, and data management systems.

I have applied these techniques in the industry through specialized services, collaboration in international consortia or during secondments of industry-academia projects.

I am always interested in the behavior of technologies used in **business-critical** scenarios in the presence of **attacks** and **faults**. I keep an eye on newly reported vulnerabilities and incidents and I study the advantages/disadvantages that each new famous language/framework brings in terms of security.
