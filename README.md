Hi, I’m Nuno,

I’m currently looking for a new challenge as **Vulnerability Researcher** or **Application Security Engineer**.



I am a 37 years old software security and dependability expert with 14 years of experience researching, developing and teaching software security, dependability, and reliability engineering.

I have been helping software engineers to create secure systems by proposing automated tools to find vulnerabilities and attacks, and also by proposing benchmarking approaches to select the best alternatives for their use.

I am expert in testing, static analysis, fault injection, vulnerability injection and benchmarking, that I have applied over the years in the assessment of the security and dependability of web and mobile applications, web services, virtualized environments, intelligent systems, and data management systems.

I have applied these techniques in the industry through specialized services, collaboration in international consortia or during secondments of industry-academia projects.  

I am always up to new challenges of studying the behavior of critical systems in the presence of attacks and faults.
